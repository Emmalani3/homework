          <p class="title">Polyamorous Dating. For poly people, By poly people!</p>
          <p class="blurb">Polyamory is becoming more common however dating sites are not serving this population. while they use inclusive language and allow users to declare their status their algorythms dont account for the complexity of the lifestyle and the fact not all polyamorous individuals are a match for eachother. Polycule seeks to fill this niche and give poply people a better chance at finding a ture match in the online dating scene!</p>

          <p class="title">Focus Faster</p>
          <p class="blurb">Kids and adults who struggle to read may have heard of or even have a reading filter tool however our digital devices hav no such tool to help us focus. Reading filter helps to highlight lines and help tech users focus on specific content.</p>

          <p class="title">Share Cost, Reduce Waste</p>
          <p class="blurb">Ever gone to the store and put something back because you didnt need that much of whatever it was? Single serve helps you share that extra cup of sugar with a neighbor who also needs just a little bit! So get that Costco pie or that 5lbs of potatoes on sale and maybe even make a new neighborly connection after.</p>

          <p class="title">Plants for Busy People</p>

Get your digital terrarium and design a beautiful arangement that you can enjoy any time any where without the hastle of keeping it alive. Like a tamagatchi but plants!</p>
